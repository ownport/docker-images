# Since we can run rootfull and rootless containers with this image 
# we create two volumes.  Rootfull Podman uses 
#
#   /var/lib/containers  
#
# for itâ€™s container storage and rootless uses 
#
#   /home/podman/.local/share/containers.  
#
# Overlay over overlay is often denied by the kernel, so this creates 
# non overlay volumes to be used within the container.
